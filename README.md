# diffsitter grammars

## Synopsis

This is a repository to keep track of diffsitter dependencies in forked
repositories.

For diffsitter we have forked the grammars so that we can use our own
`build.rs` script and statically link grammars.

## Dependencies

You'll need: `git` and `nvchecker`.

You'll need the forked repositories. We use `nvchecker` to keep track of when
we're out of date with master.
